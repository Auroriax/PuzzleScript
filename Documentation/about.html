<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to <b>PuzzleScript Plus</b> (or <b>PS+</b> for short)! This is a fork of PuzzleScript by Increpare (or "vanilla PuzzleScript") that aims to merge functionality from existing forks together into one place, and adds a couple of new features of its own.
  <h1>What should I know before I start?</h1>
<p>
  Consider making a game in vanilla PuzzleScript first! PS+ expects you to have an intermediate understanding of the workings of PuzzleScript.
  <h1>What's new?</h1>
<p>
  Here's just a taster of what you can expect:
  <ul>
  <li>Editor polish, such as a verbose mode toggle and more save slots</li>
  <li>More features to control the look and feel of your game, such as bigger sprite sizes and animations</li>
  <li>Improved performance, both automatically, as well as special features for finetuning</li>
  <li>Allow for non-linear games with the level select and the goto command.</li>
</ul>
  See the <a href="documentation.html">landing page of the documentation</a> for more info.
  
  There are some limitations though. Please consider having a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScriptPlus/issues">open issues on GitHub</a> to see the known problems.
  <h1>Porting vanilla PuzzleScript games</h1>
<p>

  Games from vanilla PS (and some forks) should work out of the box in PS+, and behave the same. If this is not the case, please report a bug!

  By default the game will have the same behavior as in vanilla PS. To unleash the power of PS+, a good place to start is by adding some prelude flags!
  <h1>Editor Changes</h1>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>You can save up to 50 projects, instead of 20. In most browsers we can store around 5MB. Which means you shouldn't go over it, unless you're working on REALLY big projects.</li>
<li>The bird button will toggle verbose_logging at runtime.</li>
<li>In the level editor, scroll the mouse wheel to switch between objects.</li>
<li>Game title is displayed in console when you save the editor.</li>
<li>Share works, but with a different GitHub authentication method. Click the SHARE button in the editor to learn more.</li>
<li>There are some new examples, see the "Load Example" dropdown in the editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to add a few extra tricks that are available in the vanilla Puzzlescript editor, but there are a few that are extra useful in PS+. For example, <b>Ctrl + Click</b> a level to load it immediately, even levels printed in the console. And use <b>Alt + Drag</b> to select text in a grid, great for editing large levels or sprites.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there's an alternate way of sharing the game if the SHARE option in the engine is not working for you: Log into Github Gists, make a gist with a file called script.txt with your PS source code.  Save the project to get an URL like <b>gist.github.com/Auroriax/65c0e7ab38cfc25806e11a6dcacfb3ad</b>. Now, append the hash from that url to the PS+ play URL, for example <b>auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=65c0e7ab38cfc25806e11a6dcacfb3ad</b>.
