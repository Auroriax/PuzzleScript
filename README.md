Puzzlescript+ is a fork of [Puzzlescript by Increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript) that attempts to gather a number of forks I often use for my own games. **DO NOTE that this fork is unstable, and you can expect things to behave unexpectedly (especially if you're going to combine functionality from multiple forks).** Access the editor at https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html

Here's the full list of the Puzzlescript forks merged into this one:

## [PuzzleClick by ThatScar](https://github.com/ThatScar/PuzzleScript)
Allows you to create objects on tiles the mouse interacts with. [More info here](https://github.com/ThatScar/PuzzleScript/blob/master/README.md).

## [Marcosdon's Solver for Puzzlescript](https://github.com/marcosdon/PuzzleScriptWithSolver)
Adds a solver that will automatically attempt to beat levels and report the solution. [More info here](https://github.com/marcosdon/PuzzleScriptWithSolver/blob/master/README.md).

## [Dario Zubovic's branch](https://github.com/dario-zubovic/PuzzleScript)
Adds in variable sprite size, level selection, and a few more things (including the [smoothscreen patch by sftrabbit](https://github.com/sftrabbit/PuzzleScript-smoothscreen)). [More info here](https://dario-zubovic.github.io/PuzzleScript/Documentation/differences.html).
