Puzzlescript+ is a fork of [Puzzlescript by Increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript) that attempts to gather a number of forks I often use for my own games. **DO NOTE that combining functionality from multiple forks is still experimental, and you could run into issues.** [Access the editor](https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html), or [check the documentation for the new stuff](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki).

There have also been some editor tweaks and even some new game functionality! [Documentation for changes & additions is here](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki). That being said, games that work in vanilla Puzzlescript should also work here.

This repo merges forks by ThatScar, Marcosdon, and Dario Zubovic, and more! Thanks to them, you can use mouse controls, sprites larger than 5x5, a level select menu, and an experimental solver. You can find the full list of forks & credits and how they work [on this repo's wiki.](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki/Merged-forks) All of the used forks & original repo are licenced under MIT, and so is this repo. See below.
