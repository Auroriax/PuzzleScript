Puzzlescript+ is a fork of [Puzzlescript by Increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript) that attempts to gather a number of forks I often use for my own games. **DO NOTE that combining functionality from multiple forks is still experimental.** Access the editor at https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html, or the documentation for the new stuff at https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki

There have also been some editor tweaks and even some new game functionality! I document stuff I change and add [on this repo's wiki](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki). That being said, this editor should still be fully compatible with games made with vanilla puzzlescript.

This repo merges forks by ThatScar, Marcosdon, and Dario Zubovic, and more! You can find the full list of forks & credits and how they work [on this repo's wiki.](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScript/wiki/Merged-forks) All of the used forks & original repo are licenced under MIT, and so is this repo. See below.
