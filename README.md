PuzzleClick Fork
============
This project is an extension that adds pointing device support (currently only mouse and devices emulating a mouse) to PuzzleScript (more info about PuzzleScript at the bottom).

Playable examples:

Editor:
------------
https://thatscar.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html  
This page shall be the most stable Puzzlescript site that uses this fork; when issues are fixed, they may take a while until the fixes end up here.
Issues and bugs are recorded/discussed [here](https://github.com/ThatScar/PuzzleScript/issues).
The main difference/drawback in this editor from the original editor is that you can't Share games. **If you want to share a game, copy the code to the original PuzzleScript editor and click Share there, disregarding compilation errors**. Then you can copy the part of the URL that comes after the equals `=` sign and paste it after this URL `https://thatscar.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=` to get a full link to your playable game.  
Alternatively, you can create a gist on Github and copy the code of the gist as the first step; this is practically what the original PuzzleScript editor does for you when you click Share, given permission to use your Github account.

How to use the PuzzleClick features:
------------
Documentation is still Work In Progress. Please look at the currently playable games to get an understanding of how to use mouse support.
